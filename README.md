## Finance Dashboard

This application manages personal finances using a Qt interface.  
The **Dashboard** tab now displays a quick monthly summary including:

- income and expenses for the current month;
- investment returns of the month;
- a financial independence index (investment income divided by recurring expenses).

These metrics are loaded automatically when the Dashboard is opened.
